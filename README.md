- 1 person fork this repo.
- other people in the team clone their repo
- base your branches off the dev branch
- make sure to make a figma and supply the link to the figma in this readme at the top.

Proper steps for branching / merging
- start from dev
- maker a feature branch named after the feature you are working on
- add/commit/push often
- after done with feature, make a pull request from your feature branch back to dev
- have someone else review the code and verify it works
  - make sure your current branch is committed
  - check out dev ```git checkout dev```
  - update dev . ```git pull origin dev```
  - make a release candidate branch.  for example rc20190805_1642 (august 8th 2019 at 4:42 pm) ```git checkout -b rc########```
  - merge in the target branch ```git pull origin <feature branch>```
  - test code on page
  - if that works, merge the next thing, if anything
  - if all work, check out dev
  - then merge your rc branch into dev
  - all new features should be based on dev
